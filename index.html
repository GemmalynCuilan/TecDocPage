      The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
      </p>

      <p>
      HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
      </p>
  
        <p>
        HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

    <header>A Brief History of HTML</header>
    <article>
      <p>HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.</p>
      <p>Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5.
        </p>
       <p>A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.</p>

    <header>Anatomy of an HTML element</header>
    <article>
      <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
     
       <li>
        The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
      </li>
       <li>
        The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
      </li>
       <li>
       The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
      </li>
        <li>
       The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
      </li>

    <p>
      As mentioned before, HTML is one of the most widely used language over the web. I'm going to list few of them here:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
     <b> Web pages development</b> - HTML is used to create pages which are rendered over the web. Almost every page of web is having html tags in it to render its details in browser.
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>Internet Navigation</b> - HTML provides tags which are used to navigate from one page to another and is heavily used in internet navigation.
    </li>
       <li>
     <b>Responsive UI</b> - HTML pages now-a-days works well on all platform, mobile, tabs, desktop or laptops owing to responsive design strategy.
    </li>
      <li><b>Offline support</b> - HTML pages once loaded can be made available offline on the machine without any need of internet.</li>
      </ul>

    <header>HTML Basic Tags</header>
    <article>
      <h4>Heading Tags</h4>
      <p>
      Any document starts with a heading. You can use different sizes for your headings. HTML also has six levels of headings, which use the elements h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 inside of <>. While displaying any heading, browser adds one line before and one line after that heading.
      </p>
<h4>Paragraph Tags</h4>
      <p>
 The p tag offers a way to structure your text into different paragraphs. Each paragraph of text should go in between an opening p and a closing /p tag
      </p>
      <h4>Line Break Tag</h4>
      <p>
        Whenever you use the br/ element, anything following it starts from the next line. This tag is an example of an empty element, where you do not need opening and closing tags, as there is nothing to go in between them.

    <header>Cascading Style Sheets</header>
      
       <p> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) describe how documents are presented on screens, in print, or perhaps how they are pronounced. W3C has actively promoted the use of style sheets on the Web since the consortium was founded in 1994.
      </p> 
     <p>  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) provide easy and effective alternatives to specify various attributes for the HTML tags. Using CSS, you can specify a number of style properties for a given HTML element. Each property has a name and a value, separated by a colon (:). Each property declaration is separated by a semi-colon (;).

   <ul>
     <li>External Style Sheet − Define style sheet rules in a separate .css file and then include that file in your HTML document using HTML link tag.</li>
     <li>Internal Style Sheet − Define style sheet rules in header section of the HTML document using style tag.</li>
       <li>
       Inline Style Sheet − Define style sheet rules directly along-with the HTML elements using style attribute.

      <p>This script could be written using JavaScript or VBScript.</p>
     <p> You can write various small functions, called event handlers using any of the scripting language and then you can trigger those functions using HTML attributes.</p>
      <p>You can keep JavaScript code in a separate file and then include it wherever it's needed, or you can define functionality inside HTML document itself. Let's see both the cases one by one with suitable examples.</p>

        <header>What is XHTML?</header>
     <article>
        <p>XML is a markup language where all documents must be marked up correctly (be "well-formed")</p>
        <p>XHTML was developed to make HTML more extensible and flexible to work with other data formats (such as XML). In addition, browsers ignore errors in HTML pages, and try to display the website even if it has some errors in the markup. So XHTML comes with a much stricter error handling</p>
       <h3>Differences of HTML</h3>
        <ul>
          <li> !DOCTYPE is mandatory</li>
          <li>The xmlns attribute in html is mandatory </li>
          <li>Elements must always be in lowercase</li>
          <li>Attribute names must always be in lowercase</li>
          <li>Attribute values must always be quoted</li>
